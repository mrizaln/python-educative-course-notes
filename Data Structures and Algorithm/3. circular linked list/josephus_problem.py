# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_problem

# Children often play a counting-out game to randomly select one person from the group by
# singing a rhyme. The purpose is to select one person, either as a straightforward
# winner or as someone who is eliminated.

# Josephus problem is related to this concept. In this problem, people are standing in
# one circle waiting to be executed. Following points list the specifications of Josephus
# problem:

#     The counting out begins at a specified point in a circle and continues around the
#     circle in a fixed direction.
#
#     In each step, a certain number of people are skipped and the next person is executed

# For example, if we have n people, and kâˆ’1 people are skipped every time, it means that
# the kth person is executed. Here, k is the step-size.
